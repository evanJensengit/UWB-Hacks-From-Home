# Covid-19 Business Trip Planner

## Goals of the Project:
This Covid-19 Business Trip Planner website is created for the purpose to address business travelers flying to other areas in the U.S.. Staying in an unfamiliar location, travelers will need to get by in making sure to plan for their trip and book for recommended services of a place to stay, hotels, and areas to eat, restaurants, as well as finding information for flights in the best deals. 
We also combined features of helping to understand the current ongoing covid-19 cases in the destinated areas, as well as areas for vaccine distribution sites that may be necessary prior from traveling. 
As a result, the goal of our project is to inform the covid-19 situations (and vaccine distribution sites) for our users who are flying across states and offering recommended resources available around them.
